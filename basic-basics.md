# Implement a Compiler - Baisc Basics

The human civilization should be impossible to be fully eliminated. So there is
no reason to believe that we need to implement the language from binary code. So
this series can be called "Implementing a computer language from 0.1". Most of
the contents are not bound to or relying on a certain programming language. Base
on my personal preference, I use vb.net for the implementation.
